terrain:
  # Dummy terrain is a class that inherits from Terrain. It creates a simple and minimal ground mesh.
  # We require some terrain class to manage spawning, observations and logic. The FlatTerrain should act similarly
  #   to the default ground mesh.
  # The opt/terrain config overrides this config to use irregular terrains.
